# Whispering Woods
a game demo i made with python and godot.

Whispering Woods is an exiting adventure game where you fight off hordes of goblins as you  defend your village from their destructive reign. Fight, run, and hide your way to victory.


In order to play the demo, you will need to download Godot and use it to open this folder.
i will add an .exe file shortly.



Enjoy!
